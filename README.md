# ESLint For eyeglass
We recommend gulp or any of the other quite amazing build tools. First, install this as an npm module:

`npm install eyeglass-dev-eslint --save-dev`

Then, when you require this module, you will get eyeglass' ESLint settings

`var eyeglassESLintSettings = require("eyeglass-dev-eslint");`

For full details on what these ESLint settings enable, be sure to read the [ESLint Rules Documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/).
